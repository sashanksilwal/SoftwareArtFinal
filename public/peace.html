          <strong> Peace, peace. </strong><br />
          We’ll not forget those who have fallen,<br />
          That’s why we need to hurry up.<br />
          My head - is a jail,<br />
          My room - is a jail too,<br />
          Messenger is my friend <br />
          And other social networks.<br /><br />

          My enemy is everyone outside<br />
          And the air they breathe out.<br />
          I wasn’t ready<br />
          For this fight alone. <br /><br />

          I breathe in slowly<br />
          And count each passing breath. <br />
          My body is barren<br />
          But my soul hurts. <br />I thought it was a dream, but it happened to be real.<br />
          The torture of the war <br />And overwhelming fear.<br />
          I want it all to go away<br />
          Diffuse in shining sun<br />
          And troubles blown from our day <br />By friendly clouds, so far <br />I want people out
          of cellars<br />
          Living to the full<br />
          Not afraid of their jailers<br />
          Sleeping soundly.<br />
          I want to throw away all the pieces<br />
          From the puzzle of this cruel war<br />
          So children don’t play with them <br />I want everyone to be happy and smile!
