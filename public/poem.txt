====================

Peace, 
Where are you? Oh, that my heart yearns for!
Oh, lost springs, oh my beloved country at peace that I pray for
Your voice is the remedy of so many souls
Of a painful mother, of a crying child and countless more
You are the peaceful soul. "Once again, every child shall have a pen in their hand. I was born and raised in conflict, but I hope to see my country free from conflict." Life will be extremely beautiful when

====================

Peace, peace.
We’ll not forget those who have fallen, 
That’s why we need to hurry up.
 My head - is a jail,
My room - is a jail too,
Messenger is my friend 
And other social networks.

My enemy is everyone outside
And the air they breathe out.
I wasn’t ready 
For this fight alone.

I breathe in slowly 
And count each passing breath
