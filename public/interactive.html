          [Intro: Drake] Trap, TrapMoneyBenny<br />
          This shit got me in my feelings<br />
          Gotta be real with it, yeah<br /><br />

          Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?<br />
          Say you'll never ever leave from beside me<br />
          'Cause I want ya, and I need ya<br />
          And I'm down for you always<br />
          KB, do you love me? Are you riding?<br />
          Say you'll never ever leave from beside me<br />
          'Cause I want ya, and I need ya<br />
          And I'm down for you always<br /><br />

          Look, the new me is really still the real me<br />
          I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me<br />
          They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options<br />
          'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'<br />
          And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'<br />
          And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it<br />
          And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it<br />
          I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it<br />
          TrapMoneyBenny, ayy<br />
          I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny<br />
          From the block like you Jenny<br />
          I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many<br />
