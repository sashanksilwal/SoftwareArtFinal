          Peace, poetry, drama, etc. Moreover, to have a compilable code, the code<br />
          should follow a set of syntax and semantics which while adding constraints to<br />
          the coder also restrains the purpose behind it.<br /><br />

          However, poetry is an escape tunnel that goes beyond the natural usage of a language.
          <br />"Even within the strict rules and regulations of software, style, manner, and
          method<br />
          are distinctive, varied, and personal." The uniqueness and character that the author
          gives<br />
          to their code, making the code invoke a certain kind of reaction or emotion from the<br />
          reader makes it a poem. Moreover, the leverage utilized by coders to go beyond the<br />
          language and use creativity in variable names, choices of structure, or hidden<br />
          meaning/messages makes it a poem. <br /><br />

          When comparing the poem Time Goes by Slowly <br />
          by Chris Boucher, to my previous submission, To My Nine-Year-Old Self by<br />
          Helen Dunmore, I found many similarities than what I would have expected. The code poem<br />
          Time Goes by Slowly is written in Visual Basic, which is a high-level language meaning
          it<br />
          derives keywords from the English language. Additionally, the author has also selected<br />
          variable names relating to English words/phrases while matching the poem sequence -<br />
