Peace, peace.
We’ll not forget those who have fallen, 
That’s why we need to hurry up.
 My head - is a jail,
My room - is a jail too,
Messenger is my friend 
And other social networks.

My enemy is everyone outside
And the air they breathe out.
I wasn’t ready 
For this fight alone.

I breathe in slowly 
And count each passing breath.
My body is barren
But my soul hurts.
 I thought it was a dream,
but it happened to be real.
The torture of the war 
And overwhelming fear.
I want it all to go away 
Diffuse in shining sun 
And troubles blown from our day
By friendly clouds, so far 
I want people out of cellars
Living to the full 
Not afraid of their jailers
Sleeping soundly.
I want to throw away all the pieces 
From the puzzle of this cruel war
So children don’t play with them 
I want everyone to be happy and smile!
